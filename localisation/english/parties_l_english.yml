 conservatism_social_credit_subtype: "Social Credit"
 conservatism_social_credit_subtype_desc: "Based off the economic theories of British engineer C.H Douglas, and further iterated upon during the tenure of the social credit party of Alberta in the 193's, social credit is an economic theory that proposes that economic depressions are caused by arbitrary discrepancies between the market prices of goods, the costs of their production and the wages of those who produced them.\n\nEssentially, in pursuit of profit, businesses have created an artificial scarcity by selling their goods at a price well above what their workers could afford. This caused the worker's lives to suffer and the economy to be hindered by low consumer spending.\n\n To remedy this, "socreds" (as supporters of this system are called) propose that the government distributes money, or "social credit" to their citizens to drive up purchasing power, encouraging consumer spending and driving up economic growth.\n\nWhile the modern Social Credit movement within Canada has largely stuck to the originally outlined economic theories of C.H Douglas, It has deviated heavily on more social issues. While Douglas originally called for the abolishment of traditional party politics and democracy, seeing it a vessel for "Jewish Influence", this aspect never caught on within the Canadian branch of the ideology. Instead the ideology has fused with moderate Christian conservatism, and has done away with the desire to destroy traditional party politics - although supporters of a more orthodox version of social credit do exist, but are largely irrelevant."
