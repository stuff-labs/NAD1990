 #Descs
 POLITICS_RON_PAUL_DESC: "Texas is broken.\n\nEver since the collapse of the union in the 30’s, the lone star state has been in a freefall towards the abyss. First: The Second Red River War, where Oklahoma and Louisiana tore nearly a million Texans from their rightful home. Then after that: The Civil War, where the republic tore itself apart, only for the rotten structure that was the first republic to survive. And to add insult to injury: Allred, the president who caused that great loss in the 30’s, refused to resign, serving as one great insult to every true Texan.\n\nBut in 1976: Came Ron Paul, the man who saved Texas.\n\nOriginally part of the Air National Guard, Paul eventually got into politics in 1968, disgusted by the state of Texas. Ever since, he has had a vision of a new alternative to the tired Republican and Democrat failures; one of a Great Texan state, united, respected, and strong - a redemption from the humiliation of the second Red River War.\n\nRon Paul can be called delusional by many. A Texan nationalist born in Pennsylvania. A libertarian in charge of a police state. A self proclaimed moderate who uses cults to spread his message. He is a man completely detached from his country; a nation of the poor, needy, homeless, and starving. A nation that wants nothing to do with him anymore. With rearmament ramping up, and tensions rising, it seems his constructed reality will finally face the ultimate test.\n\nWill it be vindicated?\n\nOr will it be shattered by the cold hard call of reality?"

 texas_events.1.t:0 "The Great Loss"
 texas_events.1.d:0 "The Second Red River War was an absolute humiliation for the young Republic of Texas. Louisiana and Oklahoma’s combined military forces overpowered the relatively weak Texan Army. The Oklahomans pushed past the Texan Panhandle. Louisiana broke through the lines of the East and captured Houston. The Texan Rangers who recently were handed back their authority were also weakened, unable to aid the Army. The Warmongering Huey Long then declared victory over our nation in half a year. Texas was forced to cede Eastern Texas and the Panhandle. War Reparations also were imposed. Not only did Texas lose a chunk of its territory, but it had also deteriorated the political landscape of the Republic, radicals began to take advantage over the loss to advocate for their cause."
 texas_events.1.a:0 "Where it all Began"

 texas_events.2.t:0 "The Texan Civil War"
 texas_events.2.d:0 "After the devastating loss, Texas faced another crisis within its electorate. Populist W. Lee O’ Daniels and President James Allred were at odds with each other during the election season. At a very close margin, James Allred won a third term. However public trust and support for Allred was at an all time low. Supporter of O’ Daniels protested and demanded Allred’s resignation. Allred attempted to calm the situation down however it was far too late, O’ Daniels and his supporters rebelled and declared the formation of the “Second Republic of Texas”. The massive rebellion cemented James Allred’s legacy of instability and failure. The Democratic Party of Texas collapsed and the Republican Party took over the reins of a bygone Texas. O’ Daniels rebels fought hard to establish a populist Texas however with the Texas Rangers empowered by the Republicans and strengthened, the Second Republic fell to the First Republic. However the Civil War devastated the countryside and Texan industry for years to come with slow recovery."
 texas_events.2.a:0 "Never Again, Never...Again"

 texas_events.3.t:0 "Mistakes of The Old Republic"
 texas_events.3.d:0 "The original Texan Republic conceived in the 30s was a failure, not only due to its failure to win the Second Red River War, but it’s system of government inherited from the United States doomed it to failure. The former United States was a region of chaos, instability, and anarchy that no democratic nation has any room in. The Republic of Texas was unfortunate enough to be in the middle of it, first it faced conflict with Oklahoma, second it faced conflict with Louisiana and Oklahoma. The Democrats and Republicans failed Texas and it’s ruined its people. We paid its price and we wait now to retake what is righteously ours."
 texas_events.3.a:0 "Spineless Politicans failed this Country"
 
 texas_events.4.t:0 "The Past Weakness"
 texas_events.4.d:0 "James Allred, a President whose legacy remains as the one who ruined Texas’ potential as a power on the North American continent. In the Second Red River War, he focused on defense instead of attack. He never planned any tactics that would have saved the nation from its loss. We recollected the war and we found out that a naval invasion of Louisiana would’ve distracted the Louisianans enough to abandoned their offensive in Eastern Texas. Not only that, but Allred refused to resign right when people began to call for his resignation. Allred attempted to amend the loss, attempted to save the Democratic Republic, and attempted reconciliation. But history has shown that cowardice like this brought us to the brink. We refuse to repeat the mistakes of the past and we shall not be humiliated once more."
 texas_events.4.a:0 "Allred was a Fool"

 texas_events.5.t:0 "Our Lone Star"
 texas_events.5.d:0 "The Republic of Texas now has forged itself into an independent nation, not bound by inherit democratic weaknesses. Under the glorious administration of Ron Paul, Texas has never seen better days. With massive expansion of the military and greater revenues from oil, Texas can now begin to prepare for another Red River War to retake its rightful land from the former Jeffersonians. Before we can begin to makes our move, Texas first must begin to expand its oil reserves and revenues to increase its capacity for war. Then it must expand its military further to be more able to win the Red River War. Lastly we must renew Texan nationalism and secure the political sphere from subversive elements that lurk in the shadows of the Lone Star. We cannot afford another failure for the sake of the Republic and the security of the Libertarian Party."
 texas_events.5.a:0 "Glory To Ron Paul!"

 texas_events.6.t:0 "Corporate Businessmen Enter Congress"
 texas_events.6.d:0 "With our recent endeavors to boost the Texan economy with Oil, we have brought forth another way to swing the Businessmen to our side. By entering them into Congress to give us more good will to the corporations. While a few Libertarians may have lost their jobs, it is the way forward. And after all we control the House and it's unlikey these few Businessmen can get any real influence in Congress."
 texas_events.6.a:0 "A few Businessmen in Congress wouldn't hurt"

 texas_events.18.t:0 "Patriot Act Passed in Congress"
 texas_events.18.d:0 "President Ron Paul has pushed a new law to Congress that will further secure Texas from the failings of old, The Patriot Act. The Act will allow the Texan Republic to use new means of preventing Terrorism and 'Threats to National Unity' from occuring in Texas. Recent events have shown that Terrorism will become an issue as Texas further advances its efforts in reclaiming its old territory. And our political sphere has to be secured from dissents, anti government figures, activists, and Non-Patriots. Our new means of detecting these people before they can ruin the nation from the shadow is imperative to our national struggle. Our Citizens will know well that dissent brings the greatest of punishments."
 texas_events.18.a:0 "All shall know that Order and Unity is the most important value"

 texas_events.15.t:0 "The Oklahoma 'Incident'"
 texas_events.15.d:0 "In the dead of night, a crew of Texan soldiers with 3 of them being disguised as Oklahoman troops, met near the Red River Valley Bridge on the border. The two fake Oklahoman soldiers set up an explosive charge on the sides of the Bridge. The Texan soldiers then hanged around the Texan side of the Bridge as the crew waited for Oklahoman Border Patrol to come by the Bridge. When the Border Patrol arrived, the Fake Oklahoman Soldiers detonated the charged and made themselves very clear in the light to show the Oklahoman flag on their shoulder. The charged exploded with the Border Patrol in utter shock as the fake soldiers ran away to while the Patrols were distracted. The explosion was heard around the county and it destroyed the middle of the Red River Valley Bridge. The Texan Soldiers who were on standby then quickly 'reported' the explosion to President Paul, the President immediately issued a condemnation to Oklahoma for staging a terrorist attack on the Texan border. The news quickly reported on the incident with the false narrative that Oklahoma commited the attack. With this in our pocket, it gives us a good reason to start another Red River War."

 ###flavor events
 texas_flavour.1.t:0 "Reporting Period"
 texas_flavour.1.d:0 "A recent report by various economists and experts who have analyzed Texas' GDP Growth over the years have concluded that the current GDP Growth of our nation is at a terrible spot. These economists claim that our vital military spending is causing other industries to be neglected and that our oil run economy is 'uneasy'. These are nothing but baseless claims that hold no truth. GDP Growth isn't a sign of a faltering economy. Ron Paul had saved the Texan economy as much as he could with the resources he had. Why should we abandon his economic policies for the sake of GDP when we are in a economic boom?"
 texas_flavour.1.a:0 "Fake News is becoming such an issue"

 texas_flavour.2.t:0 "Poverty Rate Up By 15%"
 texas_flavour.2.d:0 "Reports of the National Poverty Rate that calculated that the Poverty Rate of Texas has increased by 7% in the past few years. While many believe the issue at cause here is the economic inequalities of the Urban Areas or the lack of jobs coming in for Texas. Ron Paul's adminstration has pointed to one key issue that has caused this; Unpatriotism. With all of the Homelessness Texans see every day, it is not at the fault of the nation, but the fault of those who seek to destablize, destory, ruin, and plunder our fine nation into chaos. This issue must be tackled head on before this anarchy consumes our Republic."
 texas_flavour.2.a:0 "Patriots have nothing to fear"

 texas_flavour.3.t:0 "Homelessness Crisis Erupts"
 texas_flavour.3.d:0 "Despite our best efforts it seems a Homelessness Crisis has erupted on the streets of Houston, Dallas, and Austin. Protests have proped up with people calling for the government to 'intervene' in this matter to provide shelters and food to the Homeless. However we cannot spare any expense for the sake of the people who won't have homes nor will serve their duty as Texans. Police have been dispatched to quiet these protests down and push out any homeless people in the public streets of our most major cities."
 texas_flavour.3.a:0 "How...Unpatriotic"

 texas_flavour.4.t:0 "Brain Drain in Texan Cities"
 texas_flavour.4.d:0 "Texan Counties have in a few weeks lost a good majority of their Teachers and School Faculty with students unable to learn important life lessons in schools. The most common reason for their leave is usually the so called 'propaganda' that we give our curriculums to encourage Patriotism at a young age. However it seems some of these Teachers are Unpatriotic and leave our country for the East or West. It is becoming a crisis in the making and activists urge the repeal of 'Propaganda' in Schools. Yet what is the problem with a few Patriotic readings and history lessons?"
 texas_flavour.4.a:0 "How dare they leave Texas"

 texas_flavour.5.t:0 "Gas Station Murder"
 texas_flavour.5.d:0 "In a Gas Station during the closing hour, the Owner was shot and killed. His body was found the next day when the Wife of the Owner found his corpse. Police swarmed the scene, but no further evidence was found of a the possible suspect aside from one thing. A Quarter on the counter facing tails. Despite fingerprint scans, no possible criminal was detected. The unknown murder of the Gas Station Owner has been filed a cold case with no leads to the murderer. We hope however that this murderer may not take any more lives with him."
