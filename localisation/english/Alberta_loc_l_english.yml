 PAB_fruits_of_social_credit: "The Fruits Of Social Credit"
 PAB_fruits_of_social_credit_desc: "While initially doubtful, the people of Alberta have reaped the ripe harvest of social credit since the 1930's, even being relatively safe from the impact of the Black Monday crash.\n\nAlberta's econonomy is truly the most unqiue one on the continent, having implimented and developed on the economic ideas of C.H Douglas fully. While this idyosyncratic economy seems to function well enough, it is often infamously difficult for those outside the country to do business within it, unless that country has also adopted the socred economic model."
