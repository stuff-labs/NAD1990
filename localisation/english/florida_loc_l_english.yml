    SFL_humiliated_army:0 "Humiliated Army"
    SFL_humiliated_army_desc:0 "The Haitians fought to the death for their independence, our army was torn in ruins as the Haitians killed so many men in the jungles, forests, and the urban areas of Haiti. The army is only just starting to recover from the Haitian defeat at Mirebalais. Not only was the defeat a disaster for the army, but also for the people. National Pride was tattered. Pacifism became widespread to the public so never another Mirebalais could happen. With the Haitians on the warpath and soon to invade Northern Haiti, it is important that the army can manage to reorganize itself to fight another Haitian War."
    SFL_floridian_political_dominance:0 "Floridian Political Dominance"
    SFL_floridian_political_dominance_desc:0 "Florida was the nation that preceded the Flordo-Carribbean Union. As such Floridians have a much bigger say in government compared to the Cubans or Haitians. While the government tries to hide the clear political discrimination by appointing Cubans Figureheads in congress. The nation is a divided society dominated by Florida. Floridians have used their privileges to disenfranchise or rob the Cubans. It is only a matter of time before this issue comes to a head."
    SFL_cuban_resistance:0 "Cuban Resistance"
    SFL_cuban_resistance_desc:0 "The Cubans for a long time have been uncertain of the Union, in recent times now this uncertainty turned to outright rebellion. With the Haitians successful in their fight for independence, this has given more ammunition to the Cuban rebels striving for a Free Cuba. While the resistance isn't major enough to truely take over Cuba, if Florida suffers another defeat. There is no telling if Cuba will be so secure at that point."
    SFL_aftermath_of_the_80s:0 "Aftermath of The 80s"
    SFL_aftermath_of_the_80s_desc:0 "The 80s, despite the Haitian defeat, were a prosperous time for the Flordo-Carribbean economy. That Prosperity came at the cost of massive criminal activity, drug smuggling, shootings, and mob wars that were widespread in Havana and Miami. The 80s are in the past now as the reality of economic turmoil creeped in. The economy is at a recession as people are losing their jobs, their houses are being evicted, and our goods are no longer of the same value. Our country needs change in the economy and the government must intervene to fix it."
