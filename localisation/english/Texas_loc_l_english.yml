 STX_the_shattered_lone_star:0 "The Shattered Lone Star"
 STX_the_shattered_lone_star_desc:0 "Protest, Riots, and Political Unrest has defined the Texan political sphere for decades now. Our people are growing tired of our nationalist policies, our scathing rhetoric, and the little change that happens in Texas. Congress is at a deadlock with disagreements and massive incidents plaguing it. The government would be at it's knees if any mass protest or great disaster occurs."
 STX_legacy_of_the_second_red_river_war:0 "Legacy of The Second Red River War"
 STX_legacy_of_the_second_red_river_war_desc:0 "Texas was once poised to be a Superpower on the North American Continent, that opportunity was crushed with the loss of Eastern Texas and the Texan Panhandle. The Second Red River War was the greatest tragedy in Texan history. It is this loss that had later on caused Texas to fall into a Civil War in 1938. Then after the Civil War ended, we had to lick our wounds while the Louisianans and the Oklahomians sat back and enjoyed the riches of our rightful land. Now in recent times, President Paul has reopened the wounds of the Second Red River War, vowing to rescind the Houston Treaty and bring Texas back to it's rightful glory as a Superpower in North America."
 STX_the_great_texan_army:0 "The Great Texan Army"
 STX_the_great_texan_army_desc:0 "Ron Paul's administration has massively expanded the military and it's budget in preperation for a conflict with Lousiana and Oklahoma. Nationalist Fervor is at an all time high in the Republican Party. However this massive increase in military funding has curtailed many other industrial sectors and has reduced our funds for disaster prevention or electricity. With the economy on a less than ideal condition, we can only hope that this military bulidup will be worth it."

A Godly Texas, A United Texas, and a Great Texas led by our Great Leader who shall bring us to glory. The Republic is one and we unite under the slogan of God, Texas, and Ron Paul."

 texas_flavour.1.t:0 "Reporting Period"
 texas_flavour.1.d:0 "A recent report by various economists and experts who have analyzed Texas' GDP Growth over the years have concluded that the current GDP Growth of our nation is at a terrible spot. These economists claim that our vital military spending is causing other industries to be neglected and that our oil run economy is 'uneasy'. These are nothing but baseless claims that hold no truth. GDP Growth isn't a sign of a faltering economy. Ron Paul had saved the Texan economy as much as he could with the resources he had. Why should we abandon his economic policies for the sake of GDP when we are in a economic boom?"
 texas_flavour.1.a:0 "Fake News is becoming such an issue"

 texas_flavour.2.t:0 "Poverty Rate Up By 15%"
 texas_flavour.2.d:0 "Reports of the National Poverty Rate that calculated that the Poverty Rate of Texas has increased by 7% in the past few years. While many believe the issue at cause here is the economic inequalities of the Urban Areas or the lack of jobs coming in for Texas. Ron Paul's adminstration has pointed to one key issue that has caused this; Unpatriotism. With all of the Homelessness Texans see every day, it is not at the fault of the nation, but the fault of those who seek to destablize, destory, ruin, and plunder our fine nation into chaos. This issue must be tackled head on before this anarchy consumes our Republic."
 texas_flavour.2.a:0 "Patriots have nothing to fear"

 texas_flavour.3.t:0 "Homelessness Crisis Erupts"
 texas_flavour.3.d:0 "Despite our best efforts it seems a Homelessness Crisis has erupted on the streets of Houston, Dallas, and Austin. Protests have proped up with people calling for the government to 'intervene' in this matter to provide shelters and food to the Homeless. However we cannot spare any expense for the sake of the people who won't have homes nor will serve their duty as Texans. Police have been dispatched to quiet these protests down and push out any homeless people in the public streets of our most major cities."
 texas_flavour.3.a:0 "How...Unpatriotic"

 texas_flavour.4.t:0 "Brain Drain in Texan Cities"
 texas_flavour.4.d:0 "Texan Counties have in a few weeks lost a good majority of their Teachers and School Faculty with students unable to learn important life lessons in schools. The most common reason for their leave is usually the so called 'propaganda' that we give our curriculums to encourage Patriotism at a young age. However it seems some of these Teachers are Unpatriotic and leave our country for the East or West. It is becoming a crisis in the making and activists urge the repeal of 'Propaganda' in Schools. Yet what is the problem with a few Patriotic readings and history lessons?"

 texas_flavour.5.t:0 "Gas Station Murder"
 texas_flavour.5.d:0 "In a Gas Station during the closing hour, the Owner was shot and killed. His body was found the next day when the Wife of the Owner found his corpse. Police swarmed the scene, but no further evidence was found of a the possible suspect aside from one thing. A Quarter on the counter facing tails. Despite fingerprint scans, no possible criminal was detected. The unknown murder of the Gas Station Owner has been filed a cold case with no leads to the murderer. We hope however that this murderer may not take any more lives with him."
