    HAI_spirit_of_the_haitian_revolution:0 "Spirit of The Haitian Revolution"
    HAI_spirit_of_the_haitian_revolution_desc:0 "Just like the slaves who fought for their liberty from France, we are fighting for our own liberty against Florida. We fought over a decades long war against Florida in the countryside. By force did Papa Doc and Baby Doc save Haiti from it's doom as a Floridan colony. And we continue to fight for the total liberation of North Haiti. Our Republic has never seen such a great cultural revival. We will maintain the Legacy of 1804 and keep Haiti forever free."
    HAI_corrupt_nation:0 "Deeply Corrupt Nation"
    HAI_corrupt_nation_desc:0 "Baby Doc's administration has found it necessary to allow corruption to florish under his eye. Not for the sake of profit. Only for the safety of Haiti and it's government. Nepotism must rule in order for Haiti to prosper and remain steadfast against the Florians. Baby Doc has only he greatest of intentions for our glorious nation. Our nation will be free from Florida, only for the small price of allowing some corruption to spring up."
    HAI_militarized_economy:0 "Militarized Economic Troubles"
    HAI_militarized_economy_desc:0 "Since it's reestablishment of the Republic of Haiti, the economy has been militarized at every turn. Crops, Factories, and Goods were all turned to the military for it's sacred duty. This has given little time for our other industries to bulid itself up. But it is needed for the salvation of the Haitian Republic. Without a war economy, we would be under the American boot once again. Our people need to endure the economy if they want to see the glory of victory for Haiti."
    HAI_anti_american_paranoia:0 "Anti American Paranoia"
    HAI_anti_american_paranoia_desc:0 "When Haiti successfully secured it's independence, the nation was torn. Poverty, Corruption, and Devastation had overtook Haiti. The Haitian government saw all these issues not as a consequence of Haiti's troubled history, but a product of American infestation. Those Floridans were the cause of all of Haiti's problems. It wasn't the Haitian President's faults for a the creation of an impoverished nation. No it was the Americans who ruined Haiti for the sake of their profits. The Americans caused the various Earthquakes in Haiti. It is now the time for Haiti to crush every ounce of American activity. Kick every Floridan, every Southerner, and every American out of Haiti. The Floridans will pay for the Haitian Devastation at all cost."
