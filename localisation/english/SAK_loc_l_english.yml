 SAK_the_soviet_connection: "Soviet Connection"
 SAK_the_soviet_connection_desc: "The "Last Frontier" is very much isolated from the rest of the North American Continent with easy trade routes being nearly non-existent due to the unforgiving geography. Alaska once had to rely on the West Canadian provinces for trade and a meager amount of ships from California for trading with the American states. While Alaska for the longest time had refused to deal with the Soviet bear, Steven's Coalition has decided to forgo ideological differences with the pragmatic reality of the Soviet Union being the premier superpower of the world. This trade relationship has provided Alaska with plenty of resources, greater industrial capacity, and a relatively skyrocketing economy on the face of North America. This has not been without its downsides such as increasing Soviet influence in our country, with Alaskans fearing a Soviet sponsored overthrow of the Alaskan government and the creation of a Communist Alaskan government. These fears of increasing Soviet influence have now interrupted the comfortable dominance of the Coalition with the rise of the "Freedom and Reform Party" in Alaska."

 SAK_corrupt_democracy: "Frozen Democracy"
 SAK_corrupt_democracy_desc: "With the rise of Ted Stevens and his grand coalition, many international and regional observers have begun to notice a very undemocratic administration taking root in Alaska. With many taking notice of the "Pork Barreling" in the representative districts of Alaska and the various corruption scandals among Coalition officials with Stevens being unable to avoid allegations made against his rule. As the Alaskan Unity Coalition stands now, it is a big tent party of various interests and factions united under the zeal of Ted Stevens. The Coalition has been successful in its maintaining of its dominant majority in the Alaskan House with opposition figures being bribed or outright kicked from the House. Stevens himself has served as President for more than a decade. However recently the Coalition has begun to face its greatest challenge yet as the opposition has now officially organized under Freedom and Reform."

 SAK_the_freedom_and_reform_party: "Vogler's Opposition"
 SAK_the_freedom_and_reform_party_desc: "While the Freedom and Reform Party seemed at first a very minor oppositional force that should've been steamrolled by the Coalition's absolute popularity and dominance. That was not the case as the Party mobilized as soon as discontent from the Soviet Trade Partnership was in place. Utilizing Alaskan fears of an "eventual" Russian Communist overthrow of their democracy at the hands of Coalition, the Party gained huge amounts of support with the platform of Anti-Communism and Libertarianism at its helm. Joseph E. Vogler, the founder of the party, has become a threat to the Coalition government and without any means of silencing the Party without making the situation worse. Stevens has campaigned hard in favor of the economic benefits from the Soviet trade and with the next Presidential election around the corner, Alaska may soon face a major change decades in the making."

 SAK_petrostate_neutral: "The Alaskan Petrostate - Neutral"
 SAK_petrostate_neutral_desc: "With the discovery of vast oil deposits in Alaska during the 60s, Alaska's economy grew like never before in its short history as an independent nation state. The economic benefits from Alaskan oil has made Alaska a model for future Petrostates to follow. It has also brought social programs to Alaskans and a comfortable approval for any Alaskan government by the people. The Alaskan people can look the other way so long as no major issues or scandals emerge.\n\nThe two major oil companies in Alaska, Rosneft and Standard Oil, have understood to keep their rivalry cold for their own sake. Yet with Alaska being a very important country on the Pacific, it may likely change. Or perhaps the Soviets may try to prevent an Anti-Communist alliance from stealing a valuable asset. It does not matter either way as one company dominantes another, the Alaskan government may face a storm it cannot weather."
