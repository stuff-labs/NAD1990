 SLA_epoch_of_the_long_family_desc:0 "Louisianan politics have ruled under The Long Family for decades. Huey Long appointed loyal advisors, ministers, and even family members in his administration. Huey Long held a firm grip over Louisiana up until his death in 1972. Without Long, there was no Louisiana, atleast not under the Long Family's tight grip. Russell Long couldn't uphold Long's grip. With articles, headlines, documentaries, and papers all expressing how Long was a dictator. Long created a nepotistic government headed by the 'Long Dynasty'. This sentiment has deteriorated the JDP's popularity. Louisianans want to not be under Longism anymore. While the turn of the decade is coming up, it seems Longism won't survive the new millennium. \n\n\n\n\n£GFX_SLA_the_long_dynasty\n\n\n\n\n"
